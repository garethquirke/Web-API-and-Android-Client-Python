1. first we create a web api
2. create the model class my example is a guitar class
3. next we create our dbcontext allowing us to create tables and store data
4. after this we create a repository which will interact with database when we need it
5. create a controller class, configure the routes and allow clients to consume the data in good format - > json

6. test this on a local browser or using postman extension with chrome
7. the next step is to publish this on azure so an android device can consume the data as a client from anywhere
8. right click on the solution, publish ->
   - create a new resource group
   - add additonal services and add a database
   - give the web service a name
   - publish and exectute migrations when the project is published to the azure server
   - once publishing is complete the browser will open, test all routes and verify it works


9. Now you can begin making a client application, in this case it is an android app to consume the data
   and interact with the services such as adding, updating,deleting or querying our database collection

10. create a new android application with a blank activity.
